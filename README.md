# NESGamepad
Building a NES interactive Game pad for use on Mixer -using Firebot-
I have not used any real code so to speak i am pretty weak on the coding end.
I would definately like to learn how to code and manipulate the code i am provided.
I had rand into a issue with the A and B button basicly being help down on a button push.
My direction buttons are working flawlessly just my confirm and cancel button.
(Using a intergrated Game pad simulator which for instance when i press A on my Interactive Board
it will push the corisponding key on my keyboard eg: A button linked to A keystroke B button linked to S keystroke.
So when i press B for instance it looks as if it is holding down the S key and not letting go.
My direction up down left right work great you push it once the character moves once.
I'am and having some trouble coming up with a custom script or code
that will allow once the B button is push it presses S 1 time and then release it so it is not constently repeating.
